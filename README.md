# Banking-app
The Sparks Foundation GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Program) Task under Mobile App Development.

Basic Banking Application 

Develop a straightforward mobile application with the following specifications:

Begin by establishing a mock data set in a mobile (SQLite) database for up to 10 users. The user table should include essential fields such as name, email, and current balance. The transaction table will record all monetary transfers that take place.

User Flow: Home Screen > View All Customers > Select and View a Customer > Transfer Money > Choose Recipient > View All Customers > Access Transfer History.

There will be no login page or customer creation functionality; the app will solely facilitate money transfers among existing customers.

Technology Stack: Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript; Back-end: PHP; Database: MySQL.

The database will consist of two tables: Users Table and Transaction Table.
